# Natural Language generation using KD-trees

The goal of this small project is to generate a reasonable sentence or piece of text based on
text samples with a certain subject, such as a news category. 

The generation tries to utilize some kind of kd-tree machine learning approach, to find
the next suitable work for the current sentence.
